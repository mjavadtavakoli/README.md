# HTTP Status Codes

This document provides a categorized list of standard HTTP status codes, along with brief explanations for each.  
HTTP status codes are issued by a server in response to a client's request made to the server. They help indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed or if an error has occurred.

Understanding these status codes is essential for:
- Designing reliable and RESTful APIs
- Writing automated tests (e.g., Postman, Playwright, Go test)
- Debugging and handling API responses properly
